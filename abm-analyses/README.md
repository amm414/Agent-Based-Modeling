# Written Reports and Data Analysis of Different Models

I will compile the different analyses of different ABMs with different 
hyper-parameters to identify different patterns and trends. I will post 
a PDF that contains my academic-styled blog post content (also will be found 
[here](https://andrew-morgan-website.herokuapp.com/my-posts/) on my personal website).

Most likely will use **Python** (Anaconda, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and hopefully learning some 
new machine learning Python packages to analyze the data) and data science 
packages to analyze the data generated from the simulations. However, I may use R as well.
The source code will be posted here.
